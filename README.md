# Project Name: Backend

## Description

This project is the backend component of an application. It serves as the server for handling various functionalities and interactions with the frontend and external services. The backend is built using Node.js and utilizes the Express.js framework to create a RESTful API. It also includes functionality for working with Stripe payments and incorporates a custom Mini GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) module for generating text.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and provide necessary environment variables. Refer to `.env.example` for the required variables.

## Usage

To start the server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run server:start
```

The server will start and listen for incoming requests on the specified port. It acts as a middleware between the frontend and external services, handling API requests and interactions.

For using the GPT module, you can start it with the following command:

```bash
npm run gpt:start
```

This will initiate the Mini GPT module, allowing you to generate text using the GPT-3.5 architecture.

## Scripts

- `npm test`: Runs tests (placeholder command).
- `npm run server:start`: Starts the Node.js server using `server.js`.
- `npm run gpt:start`: Initiates the Mini GPT module for text generation.
